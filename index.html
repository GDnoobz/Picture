<p class="cen">The picture above is a very famous painting that you may recognise. The title of the painting, as said in the tooltip, is called "The Persistence of Memory." I specifically chose this painting as I know that many people struggle to find the meaning of this painting. I do remember the first time that I saw this paining, which was in grade 5. When I first saw it, the question that was asked was "What do you think this painting means?" Many, and by many I mean most of the class got stumped, and I did too. I thought for a while, until I found an answer that suited what I think of the painting. When I inspecte the painting and thought about it, I thought about everything that was happening. My final answer was that this is, well, the persistence of memory. As you can see in the painting, this does look like it would be on earth. You can tell this by the water in the background. If you look at the land and the sky, you can see that the earth isn't doing so great. The sky, while it is still technically blue, it is a dark blue, which makes me think that we have polluted the earth so much that the natural color of the sky became a darker shade of the color that it is now. If you look at the land on the right side of the painting, you can see that there isn't that much life there. This tells me that well, most life is either too small, such as a cockaroach, or has perished. Now we go into the main part of the picture. What everyone sees and gets confused by is the fact that there are melting clocks, which all show the same time on them, even though it is hard to see that. This tells me that those clocks are real, though they are distorted through a memory that, while still is there, is being altered and someone trying to be pushed away. I guess that you could say that the memory is damaged from things trying to eliminate it, which is where persistence comes in. Another thing that you can see is some sort of animal that is no longer alive, though the bottom half of it is now being faded away, just like the clocks. This means that we can assume that the animal is also being affected by the same thing as the clocks. Now here comes the big game changer. I think that this is a painting of the last memory of the last person on earth, who either perished or left the earth. I think that they are trying to keep this memory with them, though it is hard for them to do that. They are trying to keep this memory which is being wiped away and distorted. The last memory of earth is showing that there is barely any life, and that most living things are gone.</p>
